### setup

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(hoopR)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

### data import

```{r warning = F}
# write_csv(load_mbb_pbp(seasons = 2023), "pbp_data.csv")
df = read_csv("pbp_data.csv", col_types = cols())
glimpse(df)
```

### subsetting data

```{r}
sample_teams = df |>
  count(home_team_name) |>
  sample_n(10) |>
  pull(home_team_name)

# doing this to experiment with smaller data before applying to full data
sample_df = df |>
  filter(home_team_name %in% sample_teams)
```

```{r}
sample_df |>
  filter(type_text == "End Game") |>
  select(home_team_name, away_team_name, home_score, away_score) |>
  mutate(win_team = ifelse(home_score > away_score, home_team_name, away_team_name))
```



desired stats
- POA: points over opponent allowed (offensive pts over defensive ppg)
- PUE: points under opponent earned (defensive pts under offensive ppg)

first need offensive and defensive ppg for each team

```{r}
home_teams = sample_df |>
  count(home_team_name) |>
  pull(home_team_name)

away_teams = sample_df |>
  count(away_team_name) |>
  pull(away_team_name)

all_teams = unique(c(home_teams, away_teams))

off_def_ppg = data.frame(team = all_teams, off = NA, def = NA)

end_games = sample_df |>
  filter(text == "End of Game")

end_games |>
  sample_n(10)
```
